# Auth0 AI for Python

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: Auth0 AI is currently under development, is not intended for production use, and therefore has no official support.

[Auth0 AI](https://www.auth0.ai/) helps you build secure AI-powered applications.

Developers are using LLMs to build generative AI applications that deliver powerful new experiences for customers and employees. Maintaining security and privacy while allowing AI agents to assist people in their work and lives is a critical need. Auth0 AI helps you meet these requirements, ensuring that agents are properly authorized when taking actions or accessing resources on behalf of a person or organization. Common use cases include:

- **Authenticate users**: Easily implement login experiences tailored for AI agents and assistants.
- **Call APIs on users' behalf**: Use secure standards to call APIs from tools, integrating your app with other products.
- **Authorization for RAG**: Generate more relevant responses while ensuring that the agent incorporates only information the user has access to.
- **Async Authorization**: Enable agents to operate autonomously in the background while requiring human approval when necessary.

## Recommendations for VSCode Users

To streamline development with Poetry and virtual environments in VSCode, follow these steps:

1. Configure Poetry to Use In-Project Virtual Environments  
   Run the following command to ensure the virtual environment is created within your project directory (e.g., `.venv`):

   ```bash
   poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
   ```

2. Select the Correct Interpreter in VSCode

   - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
   - Search for and select Python: Select Interpreter.
   - Choose the interpreter located in the .venv folder (e.g., .venv/bin/python).
